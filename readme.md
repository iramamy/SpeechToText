# 🎧 Audio Transcription and Speaker Clustering 🔊

## 📝 Overview

This project aims to transcribe audio files and cluster segments by speaker.

**Audio Transcription**: Utilizes a pre-trained model [pyannote](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) for diarization and [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) for the transcription.

## 📂 Data

The data/audio used in the notebook is from the podcast [The Cosmic Savannah](https://thecosmicsavannah.com/) Episode 72. The transcript of the audio is also available on the website, which can be used to compare the transcription accuracy obtained from Whisper.
